You will need to download and install the following SDKs:

- Microsoft DirectX 9.0 SDK

Note: The sources have been updated to build with the latest DirectX SDK.

You may also need to install:

- Windows SDK (e.g. Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows 7 and .NET Framework 4)

To compile, double-click on BeebEm.vcproj
Then Build -> Build BeebEm
