*** BeebEm Joystick Map ***

# Joystick map file begins with special marker line as above.
# All empty lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored.

# Remaining lines must consist of two or three tokens separated with
# whitespaces.
# All names are case insensitive except for the marker in the first line.

# Two-token lines are:
# <Joystick input>  <BBC Key>
# Three-token lines are:
# <Joystick input>  <BBC Key for unshifted> <BBC Key for shifted>

# These two lines define the same mapping:
# Joy1Up   A
# Joy1Up   A   SH+A

# BBC Key names prefixed with 'SH+' indicate shifted key press.
# In the two-token lines, the 'SH+' prefix is allowed, but ignored.

# Special BBC key names are:
# LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN, BREAK, COPY, DELETE, CAPS-LOCK, TAB, CTRL
# SPACE, RETURN, ESCAPE, SHIFT, SHIFT-LOCK
# Allowed aliases:
# DEL, CAPS, CAPSLOCK, CONTROL, ESC, SHIFTLOCK

# All other BBC keys are named by their unshifted character (i.e. 'SH+[' not '{')
# Function keys are named, as one would expect, 'F0' to 'F9'

# Joystick input have form Joy[X][Act] where [X] is joystick number and
# [Act] is action name. Axis and button assignments differ between
# joystick or gamepad models.
