      <h1>Serial Port</h1>

      <p>
        In addition to connecting to the standard serial ports on the PC the
        serial port emulation in BeebEm has options to connect via TCP/IP to a
        local or remote IP address. You can use ROMs such as CommSoft or
        CommStar to connect to a Viewdata BBS, MUD server or any other type of
        server.
      </p>

      <p>
        The serial IP features are selected via the <span
        class="ui">RS423</span> dialog box, accessed from the <span
        class="ui"></span>Select RS423 Destination</span> menu option. You can
        use the "tcpser" package, which emulates a modem. Select 127.0.0.1 and
        25232 as the <span class="ui">IP Address</span> and <span
        class="ui">Port</span>. Download a prebuilt Windows binary of
        <a href="https://csdb.dk/release/?id=171299">tcpser.zip</a>. The tcpser
        source code is available
        <a href="https://github.com/FozzTexx/tcpser">here</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Run the following command to start up an instance suitable for the
        localhost setting to talk to:
      </p>

      <p>
        <code>tcpser -v 25232 -p 6400 -l 4 -s 9600</code>
      </p>

      <p>
        This will also allow incoming connections, as that does all the
        answering business and passes the caller onto the Beeb via the
        pre-existing connection. This handles the handshake lines if you enable
        ip232 mode, so dropping RTS will drop an outward connection. Similarly
        DCD going up will be passed through to CTS.
      </p>

      <p>
        Add the Commstar.rom to your ROM configuration (see
        <a href="roms.html">ROM Software</a>) and start up BeebEm. In the <span
        class="ui">RS423</span> dialog box, select <span class="ui">IP</span>,
        <span class="ui">IP Address</span> "127.0.0.1", and <span
        class="ui">Port</span> "25232". Click <span class="ui">OK</span> to
        close the dialog box then select <span class="ui">RS432 On/Off</span>
        from the <span class="ui">Comms</span> menu. Type *COMMSTAR to start
        CommStar. In Commstar:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Press M to switch to mode 0</li>
        <li>Press A to turn off Auto line feed</li>
        <li>Press I and then R a few times to set the receive baud to 9600</li>
        <li>Press C to enter chat mode</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You should now be able send commands to the modem (tcpser), try typing
        "AT", you should get "OK" back. You can now "dial" into a server using
        the "ATD" command. Try connecting to the Ishar MUD server using
        "ATDishar.com:9999".
      </p>

      <p>
        To make a direct connection to a server, put the server's IP address
        and port into the <span class="ui">RS423</span> dialog box.
      </p>

      <p>
        An additional option, <span class="ui">IP232 Mode</span>, determines if
        the handshake lines are sent down the TCP/IP link or just generated
        locally from the presence of a valid connection.
      </p>

      <p>
        A second additional option, <span class="ui">IP232 Raw comms</span>,
        disables special processing of charater 255 (used with tcpser, so leave
        Raw mode off when using tcpser).
      </p>

      <p>
        If on startup, or when ticking the <span class="ui">RS423 On/Off</span>
        menu option, BeebEm cannot connect to the specified server, or if it
        loses connection subsequently, it will report an error and disable
        RS423. Select the menu option again to try to re-connect and re-enable.
      </p>

      <p>
        BeebEm will emulate the correct receive baud rate. This makes for a very
        realistic experience when talking at 1200 baud to a Viewdata host!
        Transmitted data is just sent out as fast as it will go.
