      <h1>ROM Software</h1>

      <p>
        Although most games software is supplied on disc images there is a large
        selection of ROM software available for the BBC Micro. There are
        application ROMs such as word processors and drawing packages, there are
        programming language ROMs such as FORTH and BCPL, and a whole range of
        other software. The BBC Micro operating system, BASIC language and disc
        filing system are all supplied on ROM. Most ROMs are either 8kbytes or
        16kbytes in size. Some ROMs, such as Inter-Word, are larger, and use a
        logic carrier board to allow access to the extended memory size,
        sometimes up to 128kbytes in the case of Spellmaster.
      </p>

      <p>
        The BBC Micro and Master 128 (and BeebEm) support up to 16 ROM slots
        plus one for the operating system. The BBC Micro ROMs are kept in
        subdirectories of the <span class="file">BeebFile</span> directory. The
        is one subdirectory for each of the four models emulated.
      </p>

      <h2>Configuring ROMs</h2>

      <p>
        The ROMs that BeebEm loads are configured in the <span
        class="file">Roms.cfg</span> file. You can edit the ROM configuration
        within BeebEm using the <span class="ui">Edit ROM Configuration</span>
        option on the <span class="ui">Hardware</span> menu. Note that you
        usually have to press the
        <kbd>Break</kbd> key (F12) before a new ROM configuration is recognised.
        Changes to the ROM configuration can be saved to the <span
        class="file">Roms.cfg</span> file or another file.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Master 128 mode some ROMS may be "unplugged". This is a feature of
        the Master MOS that allows ROMs to be ignored. The ROM configuration
        editor will indicate which ROMs are unplugged (as will <span
        class="cmd">*ROMS</span>). Use the
        <span class="cmd">*INSERT</span> command to enable ROMs.
      </p>

      <h2>Running a ROM</h2>

      <p>
        To run a ROM you will need to type a command into BeebEm. The exact
        command will depend on the ROM itself and you may need to refer to any
        documentation that accompanied the ROM. Some ROMs list the commands
        available when you type <span class="cmd">*HELP</span> into BeebEm.
      </p>

      <h2>RAM Expansion</h2>

      <p>
        Any of the 16 ROM slots can be configured as RAM. Some software
        (e.g., games) can make use of this RAM so its a good idea to leave at
        least one slot as RAM.
      </p>

      <h2>Writable ROMs</h2>

      <p>
        ROMs are not normally writable but some ROM software was supplied on
        small expansion boards that had some RAM on them. These ROMs should be
        marked as writable in the <span class="file">Roms.cfg</span> file (use
        the <span class="ui">Mark Writable</span> option in <span
        class="ui">Edit ROM Configuration</span>). An example of this is the MRM
        E00 DFS ROM.
      </p>

      <h2>Essential ROMs</h2>

      <p>
        Note that certain ROMs must be present for each emulation mode to work
        so do not remove these:
      </p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>BBC Model B</td>
          <td>
            <span class="file">OS12.rom</span>,
            <span class="file">BASIC2.rom</span>,
            <span class="file">DNFS.rom</span>
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>BBC Model B IntegraB</td>
          <td>
            <span class="file">OS12.rom</span>,
            <span class="file">IBOS126.rom</span>,
            <span class="file">BASIC2.rom</span>,
            <span class="file">DNFS.rom</span>
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>BBC Model B Plus</td>
          <td>
            <span class="file">B+MOS.rom</span>,
            <span class="file">BASIC2.rom</span>,
            <span class="file">WDFS.rom</span>
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>Master 128</td>
          <td>
            <span class="file">MOS.rom</span>,
            <span class="file">TERMINAL.rom</span>,
            <span class="file">BASIC4.rom</span>,
            <span class="file">DFS.rom</span>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>
        The default set of ROMs configured for the Master 128 mode are MOS 3.20.
        The MOS 3.50 ROMs are also included. To use them either rename the
        <span class="file">BeebFile/M128</span> folder to <span
        class="file">M128-MOS3.2</span> and rename the <span
        class="file">M128-MOS3.5</span> folder <span class="file">M128</span> or
        create a new configuration using the <span class="ui">Edit ROM
        Configuration</span> option.
