      <h1>Torch Z80 Co-Processor</h1>

      <p>
        BeebEm emulates the Torch-Z80 co-processor board. The Torch-Z80 board
        was an add-on card to the BBC computers which allowed you to run CPN (a
        clone of CP/M) software. It was Z80 based, came with 64K of RAM and
        connected to the BBC via the Tube interface.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Torch had no hardware I/O of its own but used the display,
        keyboard, disc drives, etc of the host processor. Although it used the
        host disc drives, the disc formats were different to DFS or ADFS. It
        still used 80 track, double sided discs (400K) but these discs cannot be
        read on the BBC without special disc converting software. If you wish to
        create your own disc images of original Torch Z80 software you can use
        the <a href="http://www.g7jjf.com">XFER 5.1</a> program.
      </p>

      <p>
        The emulator comes as default with Torch-Z80 support disabled (to
        prevent confusion for new users). To configure support, you need to load
        a sideways ROM image for the Host Tube support. A configuration file has
        already been created for this so the simplest thing to do is replace the
        <span class="file">Roms.cfg</span> file with the
        <span class="file">Roms_Torch.cfg</span> file (backing up
        <span class="file">Roms.cfg</span> first of course!) This file simply
        loads the required MCP120-CBL (for BBC B with BBC with 8271 FDC) or
        MCP122-ABM ROM (for BBC Master).
      </p>

      <p>
        With this new configuration, running the emulator will default to a blue
        Mode 0 screen. You need to enable the <span class="ui">Torch Z80 Second
        Processor</span> from the <span class="ui">Hardware &rarr; Second
        Processor</span> menu (the emulator will reboot) and type <span
        class="cmd">*MCP</span> to enter CPN. If you try and run <span
        class="cmd">*MCP</span> without enabling the <span class="ui">Torch Z80
        Second Processor</span> off the <span class="ui">Hardware</span> menu,
        you will get a 'No Z80!' error message on screen.
      </p>

      <p>
        By default, the system will try and autoboot from Drive C and if you
        don't have a suitable disc image mounted, it will bring back an error.
        To prevent this, when typing <span class="cmd">*MCP</span>, hold down
        the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key (<kbd>Caps Lock</kbd>) and this will prevent CPN
        from autobooting.
      </p>

      <p>
        I cannot give you a full overview of CPN but typing <span
        class="cmd">HELP</span> is a good start as well as exploring the disc
        images found at <a href="http://www.g7jjf.com/disc_images.htm">Torch
        Discs</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The original Torch Standard Utilities Ver 2.0 disc and Hard Disc
        Utilities Ver 4.0 are included with BeebEm. These contain several useful
        programs to get you going.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Torch Z80 fully supports Econet emulation which provides TORCHNET
        facilities for sharing drives amongst multiple computers or instances of
        BeebEm.
      </p>
