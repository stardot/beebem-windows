      <h1>Acorn ARM Second Processor</h1>

      <p>
        BeebEm emulates the Acorn ARM Second Processor board, also known as the
        ARM Evaluation System. The ARM interpreter and disassembler code is
        based on the <a href="https://www.davidsharp.com/tarmac/">Tarmac</a>
        software written by David Sharp to whom we are grateful for allowing us
        to use it with BeebEm.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Acorn ARM Second Processor was an 8MHz system running with 4MB RAM
        on an ARM 1 RISC processor.
      </p>

      <p>
        You start the Acorn ARM by selecting <span class="ui">ARM Second
        Processor</span> on the <span class="ui">Hardware &rarr; Second
        Processor</span> menu. The ARM Second Processor has no operating system
        but relies on a sideways ROM to provide a command line prompt to the
        user. Once you see the <span class="cmd">A*</span> prompt, type <span
        class="cmd">*HELP SUPERVISOR</span> to see what in-built commands are
        available.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ARM Evaluation System came with 6 discs full of software. Disc 3 is
        included in the 'DiscIms' folder which contains ARM Basic. Load the
        armdisc3.adl disc image (ensuring you are in ADFS mode), type <span
        class="cmd">*MOUNT 4</span> and <span class="cmd">*AB</span> to load
        ARM Basic. The remaining disc images plus a hard disc image containing
        all 6 disc images can be downloaded from Jon Welch's website:
        <a href="http://www.g7jjf.com/acornArm_disc_images.htm">Acorn ARM
        Discs</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        These discs contain the Acorn ARM application software including:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>TWIN - Editor</li>
        <li>ARM Assembler/Linker/Debugger</li>
        <li>ARM Basic</li>
        <li>Lisp</li>
        <li>Prolog</li>
        <li>Fortran 77</li>
        <li>General File Utilities</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You will also find some manuals for the ARM Second Processor on Jon's
        site as well. If you have any manuals or other disc images that Jon
        does not have feel free to send them to Jon to add to the library.
