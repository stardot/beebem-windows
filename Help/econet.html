      <h1>Econet Support</h1>

      <p>
        BeebEm emulates an econet network. This allows multiple instances of
        BeebEm to communicate with other. BeebEm also supports the AUN Econet
        protocols that enable BeebEm to communicate with other AUN compatible
        machines.
      </p>

      <p>
        Econet support is enabled from the <span class="ui">Hardware</span> menu
        in BeebEm. Also switch off <span class="ui">Freeze when inactive</span>
        if you intend to run multiple instances of BeebEm so they can all run at
        the same time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each machine attached to an econet has a station number (between 1 and
        254) associated with it. An econet may also have a file server attached
        to it (special station number 254).
      </p>

      <p>
        BeebEm emulates an econet using IP datagrams. Each station on the
        network needs a unique IP address and port number combination. Each
        instance of BeebEm needs to know the address and port number of the
        other instances on the network, this information is configured in the
        <span class="file">Econet.cfg</span> and
        <span class="file">AUNMap</span> files.
      </p>

      <p>
        The default <span class="file">Econet.cfg</span> file has been set up to
        enable AUN mode. Read the notes in the <span
        class="file">Econet.cfg</span> and <span class="file">AUNMap</span>
        files for more information on configuring AUN mode.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you just want to run a few instances of BeebEm on a single PC then
        the simplest way to is to edit the <span class="file">Econet.cfg</span>
        file and disable AUN mode (set AUNMODE to 0) and uncomment the example
        network configuration for IP addresses 127.0.0.1 (near the end of <span
        class="file">Econet.cfg</span>). With this configured the first 5
        instances of BeebEm run on a single PC will get allocated unique station
        and port numbers. The first instance will be allocated a station number
        254 (file server) and next 4 will be allocated station numbers 101 to
        104. See the notes in <span class="file">Econet.cfg</span> for more
        details.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can also specify the <span class="file">Econet.cfg</span> and <span
        class="file">AUNMap</span> file names on the command line, using the
        <code>-EconetCfg</code> and <code>-AUNMap</code>
        options. Refer to the <a href="commandline.html">command line
        options</a> for more details.
      </p>

      <h2>File Server</h2>

      <p>
        An econet file server enables a disk file system to be shared by all of
        the stations on the network. Acorn produced various versions of file
        server software. The level 1 and 2 file server software is included in
        disk images with BeebEm. The server software must be run on station
        number 254.
      </p>

      <p>
        To run the level 1 server, load the <span
        class="file">econet_level_1_utils.ssd</span> disk image and run the file
        server by typing <span class="cmd">CH."FS"</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        You will be prompted for:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Number of files per user - enter <span class="cmd">3</span></li>
        <li>Manual configuration - enter <span class="cmd">Y</span></li>
        <li>Directory for first station - enter <span class="cmd">A</span></li>
        <li>Station number - enter <span class="cmd">101</span></li>
        <li>Directory for second station - enter <span class="cmd">B</span></li>
        <li>Station number - enter <span class="cmd">102</span></li>
        <li>Directory for third station - just press <kbd>Enter</kbd></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The file server will then start running and report that it is ready.
      </p>

      <p>
        The level 2 server is a little more complicated to set up. It requires
        the 6502 second processor support to be enabled and requires a special
        "master" disk to be formatted (must be a double sided disk). I suggest
        you read the "The Econet Level 2 Fileserver Manager's Guide" (available
        at <a href="http://www.bbcdocs.com/">BBC Docs</a>) if you want to set
        up a level 2 server.
      </p>

      <p>
        To use the econet file system from a station you will need to have a ROM
        installed that supports the econet file system (such as the Acorn DNFS
        ROM installed in Model B mode). To switch a station into econet file
        system mode press <kbd>N</kbd> + <kbd>F12</kbd>. The econet station
        number should be shown on screen. To switch without pressing the break
        key type <span class="cmd">*NET</span>. You can then use commands such
        as <span class="cmd">*CAT</span>, <span class="cmd">LOAD</span>, <span
        class="cmd">SAVE</span> and <span class="cmd">CHAIN</span> to access
        files on the server.
      </p>

      <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

      <p>
        The econet emulation in BeebEm is not perfect and is susceptible to
        timing issues. When a message is being sent between stations BeebEm
        waits for a short time for the econet to become free again before
        sending the next message. If the delay is too small messages can
        interfere with each other and cause a "Net Error" to be reported. If it
        is too long a station can report "Line Jammed". The waiting time is set
        by default to 100000 cycles (0.05s) but can be overridden by a command
        line option <span class="cmd">-EcoFF</span>. If you see "Net Error"
        report try a <span class="cmd">-EcoFF 500000</span>, for "Line Jammed"
        try <span class="cmd">-EcoFF 50000</span>.
