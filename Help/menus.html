      <h1>Menu Options</h1>

      <section id="file">
        <h2>File Menu</h2>

        <h3>Run Disc</h3>

        <p>Loads a disc image into drive 0 and boots (runs) it.</p>

        <h3>Load Disc 0 / 1</h3>

        <p>
          Loads a disc image into drive 0 or 1. Discs are write
          protected when loaded to prevent any accidental data loss.
          Boot a disc by pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>F12</kbd>.
        </p>

        <h3>Load Tape</h3>

        <p>
          Loads a tape image.
          See the <a href="tapes.html">Tape Images</a> section for info on
          running a tape.
        </p>

        <h3>New Disc 0 / 1</h3>

        <p>
          Creates a new disc image in drive 0 or 1. Use the <span
          class="ui">Save as type</span> field to select the type of disc image
          to create. New disc images are write enabled when created. The images
          have a standard 31 file catalogue by default.
        </p>

        <h3>Eject Disc 0 / 1</h3>

        <p>
          Ejects the disc image currently loaded. The name of the
          file currently loaded is shown next to the menu option.
        </p>

        <h3>Write Protect 0 / 1</h3>

        <p>
          Toggles write protection for drive 0 or 1. Keep discs
          write protected unless you intend to write to them. Also see the
          warning in the <a href="disks.html#corrupt">Disc Images</a> section.
        </p>

        <h3>Write Protect on Load</h3>

        <p>
          Indicates if a disc should be write protected when it is loaded.
        </p>

        <h3>Reset</h3>

        <p>
          Does a power-on reset of the emulated Beeb, useful for when a game crashes.
        </p>

        <h3>Load State / Save State</h3>

        <p>
          Loads or saves the state of BeebEm as a
          <span class="file">.uefstate</span> file. This is useful
          for saving your position in a game for example. State files are put in
          the <span class="file">BeebState</span> directory by default.
        </p>

        <h3>Quick Load / Quick Save</h3>

        <p>
          Loads or saves BeebEm state without having to specify the
          filename. The state is saved and loaded from the
          <span class="file">BeebState/quicksave.uefstate</span> file. BeebEm
          keeps the last 10 quicksave files so you can go back to an earlier
          state using the <span class="ui">Load State</span> menu option. There
          are keyboard shortcuts for <span class="ui">Quick Save</span>
          (<kbd>Keypad /</kbd>) and <span class="ui">Quick Load</span>
          (<kbd>Keypad *</kbd>) so you can save and load without having to go
          through the menus.
        </p>

        <h3>Screen Capture Options</h3>

        <p>
          Selects the resolution and file format for screen capture to file.
        </p>

        <h3>Capture Screen</h3>

        <p>
          Captures the BeebEm screen to a file. You will be prompted for a file
          name. Note that you can also use the <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Keypad
          5</kbd> shortcut to capture the screen to file.
        </p>

        <h3>Video Options</h3>

        <p>
          Selects the resolution and how many frames get skipped for
          video capture. If video and audio get out of sync when
          playing back then try selecting a lower resolution and
          lower frame rate (more skipped frames).
        </p>

        <h3>Capture Video</h3>

        <p>
          Starts video capture. Video is recorded at a maximum of 25 frames per
          second at a resolution of 640x512. Sound is captured at the sample
          rate selected in the <span class="ui">Sound</span> menu. If sound is
          disabled when capture is started then sound is not recorded in the AVI
          file. You can edit the AVIs using Movie Maker and save them as more
          compact WMV files.
        </p>

        <h3>End Video</h3>

        <p>
          Stops video capture.
        </p>

        <h3>Exit</h3>

        <p>
          Exits BeebEm.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="edit">
        <h2>Edit Menu</h2>

        <h3>Copy</h3>

        <p>
          Copies the current BASIC program to the clipboard. Sets the printer
          destination to the clipboard, enables the printer output and lists the
          current program.
        </p>

        <h3>Paste</h3>

        <p>
          Pastes the clipboard content into BeebEm.
        </p>

        <h3>Translate CR-LF</h3>

        <p>
          Adds/removes linefeed characters as text is copied and
          pasted from the clipboard.
        </p>

        <h3>Import Files to Disc</h3>

        <p>
          Allows files to be added to a DFS disc image. BeebEm will look for a
          <span class="file">.inf</span> file containing file attributes but
          files without <span class="file">.inf</span> files can also be
          imported. If a file name matches one already in the disc image the
          imported file will overwrite the one in the image.
        </p>

        <h3>Export Files from Disc</h3>

        <p>
          Allows files to be exported from a DFS disc image. BeebEm will create
          a <span class="file">.inf</span> file for each file exported to hold
          the file attributes.
        </p>
      </section>

        </p>

        <h3>Printer Destination</h3>

        <p>
          Selects where to send the printer output.
          WARNING: if you direct printer output to an LPT

        <p>
          Selects where to send the serial port data.
          Select <span class="ui">Microvitec Touch Screen</span> to enable touch
          screen support. Select an IP option to route data to a TCP/IP
          port. See the <a href="serial.html">Serial Port</a> section.
        </p>
      </section>

        <h2>View Menu</h2>

        <h3>Display Renderer</h3>

        <p>

        </p>

        <h3>DirectX Smoothing</h3>

        <p>
          Enables smoothing, which blurs the display slightly and gives it a
          smoother look, using bilinear interpolation. This option only
          applies when using DirectDraw or DirectX9 display rendering.

        </p>

        <h3>Smooth Teletext Only</h3>

        <p>

        <h3>Motion Blur</h3>

        <p>
          Fades out the contents of previous frames rather than
          blanking them out (like phosphor persistence). Can improve flicker in
          some games. The % intensities of the 8 frames can be edited in the
          preferences file.

        <h3>Real Time</h3>

        <p>
          Runs BeebEm at the same speed as a real BBC Micro.
        </p>

        <h3>Fixed Speed</h3>

        <p>
          Runs BeebEm at a fixed speed relative to a real BBC Micro.
          The frame rate may need to be reduced for the higher

        <h3>50/25/10/5/1 FPS</h3>

        <p>
          Runs BeebEm at a constant frame rate. The slower the frame
          rate the faster BeebEm runs relative to a BBC Micro.

        <p>
          Sets the coordinate range to map the Windows mouse position to. Pick
          the one that gives AMX mouse movements nearest to your Windows mouse
          movements.
        </p>

        <h3>Adjust +50%/+30%/+10%/etc.</h3>

        <p>
          Sets the percentage to increase or decrease the AMX map sizes. Pick
          the one that gives AMX mouse movements that are slightly greater than
          the corresponding Windows mouse movements. You can then match up the
          AMX and Windows pointer positions by moving the Windows pointer to the
          edges of the BeebEm Window. This is easiest to do in full screen mode.
