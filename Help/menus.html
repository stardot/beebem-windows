        <h2>File Menu</h2>

        <h3>Run Disc</h3>

        <p>Loads a disc image into drive 0 and boots (runs) it.</p>

        <h3>Load Disc 0 / 1</h3>

        <p>
          Load a disc image into drive 0 or 1. Discs are write
          protected when loaded to prevent any accidental data loss.
          Boot a disc by pressing Shift & F12.
        </p>

        <h3>Load Tape</h3>

        <p>
          Load a tape image.
          See the <a href="tapes.html">Tape Images</a> section for info on
          running a tape.
        </p>

        <h3>New Disc 0 / 1</h3>

        <p>
          Creates a new disc image in drive 0 or 1. Use the file
          type field to select the type of disc image to create.
          New disc images are write enabled when created. The images
          have a standard 31 file catalogue by default.
        </p>

        <h3>Eject Disc 0 / 1</h3>

        <p>
          Ejects the disc image currently loaded. The name of the
          file currently loaded is shown next to the menu option.
        </p>

        <h3>Write Protect 0 / 1</h3>

        <p>
          Toggles write protection for drive 0 or 1. Keep discs
          write protected unless you intend to write to them. Also see the
          WARNING in the <a href="disks.html">Disc Images</a> section.
        </p>

        <h3>Write Protect on Load</h3>

        <p>
          Indicates if a disc should be write protected when it is loaded.
        </p>

        <h3>Reset</h3>

        <p>
          "Power-On" reset for when a game crashes.
        </p>

        <h3>Load State / Save State</h3>

        <p>
          Load or save the state of BeebEm. This is useful for
          saving your position in a game for example. State files
          are put in the 'BeebState' directory by default.
        </p>

        <h3>Quick Load / Quick Save</h3>

        <p>
          Quickly load or save BeebEm state without having to
          specify the filename. The state is saved and loaded from
          the 'BeebState/quicksave.uef' file. Quicksave now keeps
          the last 10 quicksave files so you can go back to an
          earlier state using the load state menu option.
          There are keyboard shortcuts for Quicksave (keypad /) and
          Quickload (keypad *) so you can save and load without
          having to go through the menus.
        </p>

        <h3>Screen Capture Options</h3>

        <p>
          Select the resolution and file format for screen
          capture to file.
        </p>

        <h3>Capture Screen</h3>

        <p>
          Capture the BeebEm screen to a file. You will be
          prompted for a file name. Note that you can also use
          the ALT+keypad 5 shortcut to capture the screen to file.
        </p>

        <h3>Video Options</h3>

        <p>
          Select the resolution and how many frames get skipped for
          video capture. If video and audio get out of sync when
          playing back then try selecting a lower resolution and
          lower frame rate (more skipped frames).
        </p>

        <h3>Capture Video</h3>

        <p>
          Start video capture. Video is recorded at a maximum of 25
          frames per second at a resolution of 640x512. Sound is
          captured at the sample rate selected in the sound menu. If
          sound is disabled when capture is started then sound is
          not recorded in the AVI file. You can edit the AVIs using
          Movie Maker and save them as more compact WMV files.
        </p>

        <h3>End Video</h3>

        <p>
          Stops video capture.
        </p>

        <h3>Exit</h3>

        <p>
          Exit BeebEm
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="edit">
        <h2>Edit Menu</h2>

        <h3>Copy</h3>

        <p>
          Copy BASIC program to the clipboard. Sets the printer
          destination to the clipboard, enables the printer
          output and lists the current program.
        </p>

        <h3>Paste</h3>

        <p>
          Pastes the clipboard content into BeebEm.
        </p>

        <h3>Translate CR-LF</h3>

        </p>

        <h3>Import Files to Disc</h3>

        <p>
          Allows files to be added to a DFS disc image.
          BeebEm will look for a .INF file containing file
          attributes but files without .INF files can also
          be imported. If a file name matches one already
          in the disc image the imported file will
          overwrite the one in the image.
        </p>

        <h3>Export Files from Disc</h3>

        <p>
          Allows files to be exported from a DFS disc
          image. BeebEm will create a .INF file for each
          file exported to hold the file attributes.
        </p>

        <h3>Tape Control</h3>

        <p>
          Opens the tape control.
          See the <a href="tapes.html">Tape Images</a> section.

        </p>

        <h3>Printer Destination</h3>

        <p>
          Select where to send the printer output.
          WARNING: if you direct printer output to an LPT

          hang.
        </p>

        <h3>RS423 On/Off</h3>

        <p>

        <p>
          Select where to send the serial port data.
          Select Microvitec Touch Screen to enable touch
          screen support. Select an IP option to route data to a TCP/IP
          port. See the <a href="serial.html">Serial Port</a> section.

        <h2>View Menu</h2>

        <h3>Display Renderer</h3>

        <p>
          Selects how BeebEm draws to the screen.
          DirectX9 will probably be the fastest.
        </p>

        <h3>DirectX Smoothing</h3>

        <p>
          When using DirectDraw or DirectX9 enabling smoothing
          will switch on bilinear interpolation. This will
          blur the display slightly which will give it a
          smoother look.
        </p>

        <h3>Smooth Teletext Only</h3>

        <p>
          Enable DX smoothing for mode 7 only.
        </p>

        <h3>Speed and FPS On/Off</h3>

        <h3>Window Sizes</h3>

        <p>
          Sets the window size.
        </p>

        <h3>DirectX Full Screen Modes</h3>

        <p>
          Screen resolution to use in full screen
          mode. The higher resolutions may look better.

        <h3>LEDs</h3>

        <p>
          The Beeb keyboard and disc (1770 only) LEDs can be
          shown at the bottom of the BeebEm window.
        </p>

        <h3>Motion Blur</h3>

        <p>
          Fades out contents of previous frames rather than
          blanking them out (like phosphor persistence). Can improve flicker in
          some games. The % intensities of the 8 frames can be edited in the
          preferences file.
        </p>

        <h3>Screen Reader Text View</h3>

        <h3>Real Time</h3>

        <p>
          Runs BeebEm at the same speed as a real BBC Micro.
        </p>

        <h3>Fixed Speed</h3>

        <p>
          Runs BeebEm at a fixed speed relative to a real BBC Micro.
          The frame rate may need to be reduced for the higher

        <h3>50/25/10/5/1 FPS</h3>

        <p>
          Runs BeebEm at a constant frame rate. The slower the frame
          rate the faster BeebEm runs relative to a BBC Micro.

        <h3>Adjust +50%/+30%/+10%/etc.</h3>

        <p>
          Percentage to increase or decrease the AMX map sizes.
          Pick the one that gives AMX mouse movements that are
          slightly greater than the corresponding Windows mouse
          movements. You can then match up the AMX and Windows
          pointer positions by moving the Windows pointer to the
          edges of the BeebEm Window. This is easiest to do in
          full screen mode.
