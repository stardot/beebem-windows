=====================

Version 4.15 (Charles Reilly, Chris Needham, Kieran Mockford, pstnotpd,
Richard Broadhurst, J.G.Harston, Mike Wyatt, Alistair Cree, Steve Insley,
Ken Lowe, Dominic Beesley)
------------
* Fixed 320x256 screen capture.
* Enabled DirectX full screen display at current desktop screen resolution.
* Consistent file selection dialogs.
* Added debugger Alt-Tab support.
* Added Sprow ARM7TDMI co-processor emulator.
* Fixed sound register latch bug.
* Fixed wrap-around bug with indirect, Y-indexed addressing mode in the
  6502 emulator.
* Migrated source code to Visual Studio 2015.
* Fixed crash if sound sample files are missing.
* Fixed 8271 disk emulation to show disks as not ready after motor stops.
* Fixed video recording on Windows 8.
* IDE support:
  - If invalid drive selected can still access IDE command register to select a
    different drive.
  - SetGeometry sets IDEStatus correctly.
  - Seek returns correct IDEStatus for invalid/absent drive.
* Z80 support:
  - Torch inrom/outrom selection corrected.
  - Small client ROM loaded multiple times to ensure contents reflected.
* Z80 CPU:
  - Bugs fixed in IN/OUT instructions and block instructions.
  - Added repeated EDxx instructions.
  - Bugs: BIT doesn't set flags as per real hardware.
* Music 5000 Synthesiser emulation.
* General sound emulation improvements.
* Fixed graphics hold in teletext mode.
* Release Shift key on disk read after auto-booting.
* Rework teletext adapter emulation and add support for real-time packet streams.
* Fixed reads from CRTC and Video ULA registers.
* Added new DX video modes for full-screen (1440p and 4K).
* Fixed issue where BeebEm would always use the primary monitor when going 
  fullscreen.
  - Now uses monitor on which the BeebEm window is positioned.  As with all
    DX9 applications, this works best when "Maintain Desktop Resolultion" is
    selected.
* Changed the default fullscreen resolution to "Maintain Desktop Resolution".
* Added -AutoBootDelay CLI argument taking a delay parameter set in
  milliseconds creates a delay between initial boot and auto-boot of disk image
  if supplied in arguments. If used with -StartPaused, the timer starts after
  un-pausing.
* Added ability to pause the emulation, distinct from freezing when focus lost.
  - Menu item on Speed menu.
  - Alt+F5 will pause/unpause.
  - The -StartPaused CLI argument can be used to prevent the emulation from
    starting until unpaused. Implemented to better support
    HyperSpin/RocketLauncher configurations where you want to defer boot until
    the BeebEm window and bezels are shown, and any Fade screen has been removed.
  - If in windowed mode and showing fps, pause state is shown in window title.
* Improved Computech IntegraB startup defaults, and correct the current year
  calculation. Also included is a patched IBOS ROM where two digit years are
  assumed to be 20xx instead of 19xx.
* Fixed BCD mode in ADC and SBC instructions.
* Fixed key selection dialog box layout for Windows 10.
* Added -DebugLabels command line option to load BeebAsm compatible debug labels.
* Added PC joystick to BBC keyboard mapping.

Version 4.14 (J.G.Harston, Steve Pick, Mike Wyatt)
------------
* IDE hard drive interface.
  - Limited IDE_Geometry command supported, allows 4 heads x 64 sectors
    (disks up to 512M), and 16 heads x 64 sectors (disks larger than 512M).
  - SCSI and IDE hard drives selectable/configurable.
  - Disk images referenced by DiscsPath setting.
* Double-sided SSD disks supported (image file>&40000 bytes long).

  - Changed SW RAM write enable menu to show slots containing RAM and
    disable the ROM slots.
  - RAM slots enabled now saved in preferences.
  - Added write through to the first RAM bank when writing to ROM address
    range (&8000-&BFFF).
  - Added SW RAM board emulation where the active RAM bank is selected by
    the User VIA port B output.
* Added AtoD to saved state. Joystick should now work after restoring a
  state file.
* Fixed joystick capture error when enabled for a second time.

Version 4.11 (Rob O'Donnell, Rich Talbot-Watkins, Mike Wyatt)
------------
* Added AUN Econet support.
* Added 'RAW comms' option for use with the serial port IP options.
* Updated video emulation to remove screen stretching and fix cursor 
  positioning.
* Added some more shortcut keys, for use on laptops primarily:
    ALT 1  Quick save state
    ALT 2  Quick load state
    ALT 5  Capture screen to file
    ALT +  Increase emulation speed
    ALT -  Decrease emulation speed

Version 4.10 (Mike Wyatt)
------------
* Added screen capture options to the file menu.  Resolution and file format
  can be selected.  The BMP, JPEG, GIF and PNG file formats are supported.
  ALT+keypad 5 (with NumLock on) is a shortcut key for capturing the screen 
  to file.
* Added option to change the User Data folder location.
* Added keyboard mapping to the saved emulator state.
* Fixed issue with file offsets after break key press in 1770 controller.
* Fixed issue with disc write protection when changing Beeb model.
* Fixed sound muting while Window is being moved.
* Changed source code licensing to the GNU General Public License.
* Removed the Master 512 Co-Processor and TMS5220 Speech Generator emulation
  as the source code licensing for these features is not compatible with the
  GPL.  These two features are still available in BeebEm version 4.03, which
  is on the BeebEm website.

Version 4.02 (Mike Wyatt)
------------
* Added disc drive sound emulation.
* Added write support for the Master real time clock.
* Fixed teletext mode smoothing at startup in Vista.

Version 4.01 (Steve Pick, Mike Wyatt)
------------
* Rewrote debugger command interpreter:
  - Supports command names longer than one character
  - Added command history (up/down arrows when command box focused)
  - Commands are now implemented using function pointers, should be more
    expandable.
  - More descriptive help - type 'help', 'help <command>' or 'help <addr>'.
  - Better label support - any word in command arguments preceded with a '.'
    is interpreted as a label and resolved before the args are passed to
    the command handler.
* Fixed bug that prevented checkboxes enabled/disabled by command from
  actually taking effect.
* Expanded debug memory map support:
  - Maps can now be stored for each ROM, just put a .map file with the same
    name as the ROM in the ROM's directory, for example BeebFile\BBC\os12.map
    corresponds to BeebFile\BBC\OS12.ROM, and address queries (via 
    'help <addr>') will return info from the currently selected ROM's map.
  - Address info queries now understand shadow/private/sideways RAM in
    different machines.
  - Cleaned up MemoryMap.txt and moved it to BeebFile\BBC\OS12.map
* Added 'state m' command to get state of memory (ACCCON and Shadow/Sideways
  RAM info)
* Added routines for extracting header info from paged ROMs, and 'state r'
  command to dump this info in the debugger.
* Break now shows previous Program Counter address as well as the current
  address. This is useful for finding where the source of a jump was.
* A bit of a hack to allow debug window to go behind main window, but also
  come to foreground with main window.
* Added option to enable DirectX smoothing when only in teletext mode.

Version 4.0 (Mike Wyatt, Rob O'Donnell, Steve Pick)
-----------
* Added clipboard functionality from the Mac port.  Clipboard can be set as
  destination for printer output, copy and paste menu options for BASIC
  programs.
* Added file import/export for DFS disc images loaded into BeebEm.  The
  exported files use the standard archive format where .INF files store the
  file attributes.
* Added support for disc, state and tape file specific preferences.  When
  loading a file from the command line, running a disk image or loading a
  state file BeebEm will check for Preferences.cfg and Roms.cfg files in the
  same folder as the image file.  This makes it easier to set up different
  preferences for different programs.
* Added ALT-ENTER keypress to toggle fullscreen mode.
* Creation of registry entries at installation:
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\BeebEm\InstallPath
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\BeebEm\Version
* Reduced the tape control window size so it fits on a Netbook screen.
* Added Rob's IP options for serial port emulation.  Allows connection via
  TCP/IP to local or remote IP address.  Incoming connections can be
  supported via utilities such as tcpser.
* Debugger enhancements from Steve:
  - User-defined breakpoints and watches.
  - Break on BRK instruction.
  - Support for loading VICE format label files, as generated by LD65 - this
    lets you use text labels in place of addresses in all debugger commands.
  - Memory map file allows short descriptions for memory ranges. Debugger
    will use this to describe what location it's entered OS code at, or
    where the break landed.
  - Commands to toggle various UI checkboxes.
  - Command to echo a line of text to debugger output.
  - Debugger commands can now be loaded from a script file specified on the
    BeebEm command line (with -DebugScript). Simple comments are also
    supported.
  - Sanitized some code, added DisplayDebugInfoF(format, ...) to output
    formatted debugging info, sprintf() style.
  - Beautified the debugging UI a bit.

Version 3.85 (Mike Wyatt)
------------
* Fixed disc formatting using the 8271 controller.
* Video update / capture fix from Rich.
* Reduced CPU load when execution is halted in the debugger.
* Added three new debugger commands:
    "g" to goto an address
    "fr" to read a file into host RAM
    "fw" to write a file from host RAM

Version 3.84 (Mike Wyatt)
------------
* Added menu option to display cursor line at bottom of screen.
* Added \d option to -KbdCmd command line parameters
* Made -KbdCmd processing more resilient

Version 3.83 (Mike Wyatt)
------------
* Added -NoAutoBoot command line option.

Version 3.82 (Rich Talbot-Watkins, Mike Wyatt)
------------
* Periodic noise emulation tweak from Rich.
* Video emulation fixes from Rich.
* AVI capture fix.  When AVI is enabled the video frame rate is now fixed
  to match the capture rate.  This should stop video and sound getting out
  of sync.
* Changed CMOS default for print destination to the parallel port.  Printer
  options should work correctly in Master mode now.
* Added support for loading tape images from the command line.
* Added -KbdCmd command line option to specify a key press sequence to run
  at start up (can be used to run a tape image).

Version 3.81 (Mike Wyatt, Jon Welch)
------------
* Added -DisMenu command line option to disable the menus.
* Fixed issue where sound output stops after about 10 mins.
* Corrected the fix in v3.8 for sound artifacts.  Sampled sound works 
  correctly again.
* Added periodic noise emulation tweak from Rich Talbot-Watkins.
* Updated instructions for defining user keyboard mappings (thanks to
  Jonathan Bluestone).
* Bug fix - Cursor position wrong when in column 1 in editing mode.

Version 3.8 (Mike Wyatt, Jon Welch)
-----------
* Enhanced user defined key mapping support.  Shifted and unshifted key 
  presses can now be defined separately so custom logical mappings can be
  defined.
* Added load and save options for user defined key mappings.
* Corrected emulation of PLY processor instruction.
* Fixed bug in sound emulation that was causing sound artifacts.
* Set root directory to $ for new ADFS images.
* Fixed keyboard interrupt handling (can now enter name in Super Pool
  high score table).
* Added some preference options to autosave CMOS and all of the prefs on
  exit.  Also, by popular demand, added a prefs option to remember the last
  folder used for loading disc/tape/state files.
* Fixed disc write protect menu update when ejecting a disc.
* Increased default Econet flag fill timeout to 250000.  Improves Econet 
  comms a bit (still not 100% though).

Version 3.7 (Jon Welch)
-----------
* Added ARM Second Processor support.

Version 3.6 (Mike Wyatt, Jon Welch)
-----------
* Made BeebEm Vista compatible.
* Added support for DirectX9 so image output looks good in Vista.
* Moved all preferences from the Window registry to the Preferences.cfg
  file. CMOS settings also moved from cmos.ram to the prefs file.
* Preferences such as Window position, FDC selection and CMOS settings 
  are now only saved when "Save Preferences" is used.
* Moved all "user" data such as disk images, tape images, state files,
  config files, etc. to the user's "My Documents\BeebEm" directory.
  BeebEm will copy a default set of data files to "My Documents\BeebEm" 
  if the directory does not exist.  Each user will have their own data 
  files and preferences.
* Added command line options to specify user data directory, preferences
  file and roms configuration file.  This allows different BeebEm 
  preferences and configurations to be set up and selected via the command
  line.  Also allows BeebEm to be run from a USB drive without affecting 
  the host PC (run via the BeebEmLocal.vbs script).
* Added 'Protect on Load' to disc options menu to select default write 
  protect state when a disc is loaded.
* Added some more Window and full screen sizes.
* Change to use Inno Setup for installation.  Installer will move any user
  data files from "\Program File\BeebEm" to "My Documents\BeebEm".
* Fixed keyboard handling bug with the shift key.
* Fixed write protection toggling when using 1770 DFS emulation.
* Fixed error handling for open file failure in 1770 DFS emulation.
* Fixed write protection reporting in 8271 DFS emulation.
* Fixed preference saving for sound on/off and AMX on/off.

  from Brilliant Computing)
* Added user port breakout box
* Added digital mousestick option
* Fixed joystick emulation in Master 128 mode
* Fixed problem of ESC key not always being detected
* Fixed problem of accessing files when ADFS and DFS discs loaded side by side
* Fixed a couple of tape related game loading problems
* Fixed interrupt clearing issue in 8271 disk emulation (fixes save/restore
  state in Twin Kingdom Valley)
* Minor VIA timing tweak to make Snapper work again

Version 3.3 (Mike Wyatt)
-----------
* Added menu options to enable/disable Teletext adapter and hard drive
  emulation.  When enabled they cause corruption of Alien8 data.
* Removed ADFS and ATS ROMs from Model-B configuration as they were causing
  a few problems.
* Improved VIA and interrupt timing and fixed instruction cycle count for 
  branches.  The following programs now run:
    Nightshade (tape), Lancelot, The Empire Strikes Back, Dabs Fingerprint,
    Yie Ar Kung-Foo (tape)
* Added "Eject Disc" options to the file menu.  The name of the currently 
  loaded image file is shown next to the menu option.
* Added two new debugger commands:
    "c" to change memory contents
    "w" to write the debug output buffer to a file
* Change sound volume to be exponential (suggested by Rich Talbot-Watkins).
  Seems to be a definite improvement on the linear scale.  There is a menu
  option to switch between the two.

Version 3.2 (Jon Welch)
-----------
* Added support for Acorn Z80 Co-Processor
* Added support for Master 512 Co-Processor
* Added support for Acorn Teletext Adapter
* Added some enhancements to the debugger from Thomas Horsten.  Display of
  stack register and op codes for undocumented instructions.

Version 3.11 (Mike Wyatt)
------------
* Fixed random crashes

Version 3.1 (Mike Wyatt, Rob O'Donnell, Jon Welch)
-----------
* Added econet emulation.  It works in Model B mode and Master 128 mode.
  The Acorn level 1 and 2 file server software runs and stations can 
  read/write files to the server.  Note that the default DFS ROM in Model B
  mode has been changed to the Acorn DNFS ROM.
  (Note also that TORCHNET works using the Torch Z80 Co-Processor)
* Added some more command line options.  The hardware model and tube support
  can be specified on the command line.  See the notes in readme.txt.
* Fixed default read value for IO pages FRED and JIM.  Fixes graphics
  corruption in tape version of Alien 8.

* Added SASI Torch Z80 Hard Disc support
* Removed IDE support as no longer needed
* Added Acorn ADFS 1.3 ROM to Model B and B Plus modes so SCSI hard disks
  can be used.
* Fixed problem with Alt key where certain keys get locked down
* Fixed econet station allocation on PCs with multiple network
  interfaces/cards (thanks to Sam Skivington).
* Added keyboard shortcuts for Quicksave (keypad /) & Quickload (keypad *).
  Quicksave now keeps the last 10 quicksave files so you can go back to an
  earlier state using the load state menu option.
* Changed to ignore DirectX errors during screen update.  Stops BeebEm 
  reporting an error when switching between a full and non-full screen mode
  instances of BeebEm.  DirectX appears to sort itself out after a second 
  or two!
* Fixed disk initialisation in the 1770 controller when creating a new disk
  image.
* Fixed disk formatting with the 1770 controller.

Version 3.0 (Mike Wyatt)
-----------

  Its still not perfect but its good enough to run various versions of the
  infamous "Kevin Edwards" protection code!  The following tapes now load 
  and run:
    Knight Lore, Alien 8, Daley Thompson Supertest, Strykers Run,
    Exile, Joust, Galaforce
  These are the only ones I've tried, others may work as well.
* Fixed bug in horizontal displayed register emulation.  Joust tape loading
  screen now appears centered correctly.

  errors occurring when running Micropower Roulette.
* Fixed bug in virtical displayed/total register emulation for mode 7.
  Screen is now cleared below lines that are displayed.
* Added AVI video capture to the file menu (now with resolution and frame
  skip options).
* Changed command line parsing so it works when paths are enclosed in 
  quotes and it now supports loading of UEF state files (thanks to Jasper
  for this one).  Disk and state files can now be associated with BeebEm
  and run by double clicking on them.
* Fixed bug in IDE hard disk file access that prevented BeebEm from running
  when logged in as an unprivileged user on Windows XP.
* Fixed bug with window positioning when task bar is on left or top of 
  screen.
* Bumped version to 3.0 to keep in sync with the Mac version of BeebEm.

  version of Elite quite nicely but you will need a reasonably fast PC.
* Added Debugger (see Readme.txt for details).
* Fixed more bugs in the video emulation (fixes Uridium, improves Level 9
  graphical adventures in Master mode).
* Fixed bugs in the joystick and AtoD emulation (SuperPool now works and it
  may fix problems with GamePads).
* Tweaked sound tuning and noise generation.
* Floppy controller selection is now saved for each Model B type.
* Changed default DFS for B+ to the V2.26 Acorn 1770 DFS.
* Rearranged menus a bit as options was getting too big.

Version 1.6 (Ken Lowe & Mike Wyatt)
-----------
* Added BBC Computech IntegraB Support:
  RTC Memory
  Private Memory 1K from &8000 to &83FF

  20K Shadow RAM from &3000 to &7FFF
  12K Paged RAM
  (Level 9 graphical adventures work in IntegraB & B Plus modes)
* Fixed various bugs in Via Timers (Volcano, Nutcraka, Pedro and Skirmish
  now work).
* Fixed various bugs in UEF state store/restore, particularly for SW RAM
  usage and Master 128 mode (Elite & Exile save/restore now reliable).
* Added disc settings to the UEF state.  When a state is restored BeebEm
  will load the disc images that were loaded when the state was stored.
* Fixed various bugs in the video emulation (fixes Psycastria and Level 9
  graphical adventures, improves FireTrack).
* Changed video emulation so that *TV255 does not move screen down (*TV254 
  does though). Some programs do a *TV255 and the bottom line of the screen
  is lost.
* Fixed reload of drive 1 disc image after a File->Reset.
* Fixed BeebDiscLoad environment variables in Model B modes.
* Fixed ADFS boot (A+Break) in Master 128 mode.

* Added some more fixed speed settings (you can now play Elite at a 
  decent speed!).
* Put quick load and save back the right way!
* Add a link to the README file to the help menu.
* Changed keyboard maps to default and logical layouts.  The default 
  mapping is the same as the old mapping 1.  Logical mapping maps symbol
  by symbol (for a UK PC keyboard at least) so you get what you press.
* Added keyboard mapping options for A & S and function keys.
* Changed ALT and F10 to normal keys so they no longer select the menu.
  F10 is mapped to f0.

  20K Shadow RAM from &3000 to &7FFF (still very slightly buggy, but usable)
  Added all documented 65C12 Opcodes extra to the 6502
  Added _simple_ 1770 FDC - Read only at present
  Made some hardware re-arrange to alternate locations on a Master
  (The A to D convertor is accessed the same, but at a different location)
* Implemented "available models" detection, only models that you have the
  roms for will be available, if neither available, the program exits.
* Added BBC Model Type Menu to Options Menu

Version 1.04 (Robert Schmidt)
------------
Windows update only:
* Remember last used directories for disc images and emulator states.
* Dialog for opening disc images has 3 new filters:
    - Automatic *.ssd/*.dsd detection
    - *.ssd only
    - *.dsd only
* Support for higher DirectDraw resolutions, through new sub menu.
  (1280x1024 makes aliasing effects unnoticable, but requires a fast
  DirectDraw implementation.)
* Added option to use 32-bit DirectDraw modes in full screen, as opposed
  to 8-bit. (In a window, DirectDraw uses the desktop color depth.)
  When combined with "Buffer in video RAM", the result is a *superior*, 
  interpolated display!  Scaling artifacts "disappear" at any resolution.
* Made "Full Screen" a toggle, not a standalone mode/"window size".
* Fixed a bug that didn't show speed/FPS in a windowed DirectDraw mode.

Version 1.03 (Robert Schmidt)
------------
Windows update only:
Monochrome monitor/B&W TV emulation

Version 1.02 (Mike Wyatt)
------------
Added Robert's Freeze when Inactive option.

Version 1.01 (Mike Wyatt)
------------
Fixes the problem with BeebEm hanging after about 35 minutes. 

Version 1.0 (Mike Wyatt)
-----------
Switchable DirectDraw and DirectSound.
Fixed Windows message boxes when using DirectDraw.
Printer support.
Improved ROM size checking.
Improved speed regulation code.

Version 0.9 (Mike Wyatt)
-----------
Added AMX mouse support.

Converted to use DirectX and added a full screen option.

Fixed a few bugs (thanks to Piers Haken for pointing out a bug in the video
code).

Version 0.8 (Mike Wyatt & Laurie Whiffen)
-----------
Added disc write and format capability.

Changed disc load code to give a warning if disc image loaded looks like its
been loaded using wrong type (single/doubled sided).

MS Windows version only:
  Fixed so all key presses are released when windows looses focus.
  Rom slots can be individually changed between ROM and RAM using the menus.
  Added user definable keyboard mapping options.
  User preferences (including the keyboard mapping) can be saved in an INI
    file using a new menu option.
  Added menu options for write protection and creating new disc images.

Version 0.71 (Mike Wyatt)
------------
Changed VIA timer latches initial value to 0xffff (Castle Quest now works).

Fixed BCD addition and substraction and prevented mode 7 code from dividing
by zero (Exile now works).

Changed VIA code so the data direction registers can be read (Codename Droid
now works).

Fixed cursor colour in UNIX version.

Added sideways RAM support (so Exile can be played full screen).

Version 0.7 (Mike Wyatt)
-----------
Added conditional compilation for all the Microsoft Windows code. Should only
need to maintain one set of source files for both the X and MS Win versions.

Changed sound code so it does not play a sound until both the high and low
bytes of the frequency have been set (eliminates spurious high pitch beeps).

Video module now generates a cursor.

Implemented a load of undocumented 6502 instructions.

Directed read and writes to the 16 bytes above each VIA back down to
the VIAs (Castle Quest uses the higher addresses).

Added the atodconv module to provide Analogue to Digital support.  Added the
beebstate module to provide Save and Restore of Beeb State files.  These two
new modules should compile under UNIX but there is currently no code in the
X Windows version to use them.

MS Windows version now provides:
  Load of menus to control everything
  Dynamic disc selection
  Beeb State save and restore
  Various Window sizes
  Real time and fixed frame rate modes
  Sound support
  Joystick support
  Mousestick support
  ROM write protection
  Multiple ROM initialisation
  Games keyboard mapping
  Pentium optimised version

Version 0.6
-----------
A few fiddles with the config for linux - now compiles on 2.7.0 with the ELF-GCC
release; but could cause probs for older releases.

Stated adding sound card.

Version 0.5
-----------
Improved timing - mode 7 bodged to exactly correct cycle count
Interlace timing accounted for in modes 0-6.
Interrupt latency added
fixed window.cc (took out 'virtual' on most functions) - now OK in gcc 2.7.0
Changed default position of g++ includes to /usr/include/g++
