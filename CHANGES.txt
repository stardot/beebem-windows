BeebEm Change History
=====================

Version 3.7 (Jon Welch)
-----------
* Added ARM Second Processor support.

Version 3.6 (Mike Wyatt, Jon Welch)
-----------
* Made BeebEm Vista compatible.
* Added support for DirectX9 so image output looks good in Vista.
* Moved all preferences from the Window registry to the Preferences.cfg
  file. CMOS settings also moved from cmos.ram to the prefs file.
* Preferences such as Window position, FDC selection and CMOS settings 
  are now only saved when "Save Preferences" is used.
* Moved all "user" data such as disk images, tape images, state files,
  config files, etc. to the user's "My Documents\BeebEm" directory.
  BeebEm will copy a default set of data files to "My Documents\BeebEm" 
  if the directory does not exist.  Each user will have their own data 
  files and preferences.
* Added command line options to specify user data directory, preferences
  file and roms configuration file.  This allows different BeebEm 
  preferences and configurations to be set up and selected via the command
  line.  Also allows BeebEm to be run from a USB drive without affecting 
  the host PC (run via the BeebEmLocal.vbs script).
* Added 'Protect on Load' to disc options menu to select default write 
  protect state when a disc is loaded.
* Added some more Window and full screen sizes.
* Change to use Inno Setup for installation.  Installer will move any user
  data files from "\Program File\BeebEm" to "My Documents\BeebEm".
* Fixed keyboard handling bug with the shift key.
* Fixed write protection toggling when using 1770 DFS emulation.
* Fixed error handling for open file failure in 1770 DFS emulation.
* Fixed write protection reporting in 8271 DFS emulation.
* Fixed preference saving for sound on/off and AMX on/off.
* Added preliminary 300 baud support for CSW, Swarm now loads
* Added hard disc activity LED's
* Added CSW support to Tape Control window
* Added support for Level 3 Econet User Port RTC Module
* Added support for mixed mode ADFS/NETFS format discs

Version 3.5 (Mike Wyatt, Theo Lindebaum, Jon Welch)
-----------
* Added text to speech support and screen reader compatible text view for 
  use by visually impaired people.
* Fixed support for MOS 3.50 in Master 128 mode.
* Fixed a bunch of compiler warnings thrown up by VS2005.
* Fixed some odd keyboard behaviour associated with AltGr key presses.
* Fixed bug with speech output changing speed/pitch.
* Fixed problem of saving to ADFS hard disc under 65C02 emulation.
* Fixed user defined keyboard support so that shift key re-assignments
  work.
* Added menu options to disable selected keys within BeebEm.

Version 3.4 (Jon Welch)
-----------
* Added preliminary support for loading CSW format tape images
* Added emulation of Microvitec touch screen (can be used with software 
  from Brilliant Computing)
* Added user port breakout box
* Added digital mousestick option
* Fixed joystick emulation in Master 128 mode
* Fixed problem of ESC key not always being detected
* Fixed problem of accessing files when ADFS and DFS discs loaded side by side
* Fixed a couple of tape related game loading problems
* Fixed interrupt clearing issue in 8271 disk emulation (fixes save/restore
  state in Twin Kingdom Valley)
* Minor VIA timing tweak to make Snapper work again

Version 3.3 (Mike Wyatt)
-----------
* Added menu options to enable/disable Teletext adapter and hard drive
  emulation.  When enabled they cause corruption of Alien8 data.
* Removed ADFS and ATS ROMs from Model-B configuration as they were causing
  a few problems.
* Improved VIA and interrupt timing and fixed instruction cycle count for 
  branches.  The following programs now run:
    Nightshade (tape), Lancelot, The Empire Strikes Back, Dabs Fingerprint,
    Yie Ar Kung-Foo (tape)
* Added "Eject Disc" options to the file menu.  The name of the currently 
  loaded image file is shown next to the menu option.
* Added two new debugger commands:
    "c" to change memory contents
    "w" to write the debug output buffer to a file
* Change sound volume to be exponential (suggested by Rich Talbot-Watkins).
  Seems to be a definite improvement on the linear scale.  There is a menu
  option to switch between the two.

Version 3.2 (Jon Welch)
-----------
* Added support for Acorn Z80 Co-Processor
* Added support for Master 512 Co-Processor
* Added support for Acorn Teletext Adapter
* Added some enhancements to the debugger from Thomas Horsten.  Display of
  stack register and op codes for undocumented instructions.

Version 3.11 (Mike Wyatt)
------------
* Fixed random crashes
* Fixed display of LEDs

Version 3.1 (Mike Wyatt, Rob O'Donnell, Jon Welch)
-----------
* Added econet emulation.  It works in Model B mode and Master 128 mode.
  The Acorn level 1 and 2 file server software runs and stations can 
  read/write files to the server.  Note that the default DFS ROM in Model B
  mode has been changed to the Acorn DNFS ROM.
  (Note also that TORCHNET works using the Torch Z80 Co-Processor)
* Added some more command line options.  The hardware model and tube support
  can be specified on the command line.  See the notes in readme.txt.
* Fixed default read value for IO pages FRED and JIM.  Fixes graphics
  corruption in tape version of Alien 8.
* Fixed bug in video emulation where it was attempting to display one too
  many lines causing visual artifacts (thanks to Phil Sainty for
  highlighting this one).
* Added SCSI ADFS Hard Disc support
* Added SASI Torch Z80 Hard Disc support
* Removed IDE support as no longer needed
* Added Acorn ADFS 1.3 ROM to Model B and B Plus modes so SCSI hard disks
  can be used.
* Fixed problem with Alt key where certain keys get locked down
* Fixed econet station allocation on PCs with multiple network
  interfaces/cards (thanks to Sam Skivington).
* Added keyboard shortcuts for Quicksave (keypad /) & Quickload (keypad *).
  Quicksave now keeps the last 10 quicksave files so you can go back to an
  earlier state using the load state menu option.
* Changed to ignore DirectX errors during screen update.  Stops BeebEm 
  reporting an error when switching between a full and non-full screen mode
  instances of BeebEm.  DirectX appears to sort itself out after a second 
  or two!
* Fixed disk initialisation in the 1770 controller when creating a new disk
  image.
* Fixed disk formatting with the 1770 controller.

Version 3.0 (Mike Wyatt)
-----------
* Improved VIA timing emulation and fixed some instruction cycle counts.
  Its still not perfect but its good enough to run various versions of the
  infamous "Kevin Edwards" protection code!  The following tapes now load 
  and run:
    Knight Lore, Alien 8, Daley Thompson Supertest, Strykers Run,
    Exile, Joust, Galaforce
  These are the only ones I've tried, others may work as well.
* Fixed bug in horizontal displayed register emulation.  Joust tape loading
  screen now appears centered correctly.
* Fixed bug in virtical sync position register emulation.  Stops DirectX 
  errors occurring when running Micropower Roulette.
* Fixed bug in virtical displayed/total register emulation for mode 7.
  Screen is now cleared below lines that are displayed.
* Added AVI video capture to the file menu (now with resolution and frame
  skip options).
* Changed command line parsing so it works when paths are enclosed in 
  quotes and it now supports loading of UEF state files (thanks to Jasper
  for this one).  Disk and state files can now be associated with BeebEm
  and run by double clicking on them.
* Fixed bug in IDE hard disk file access that prevented BeebEm from running
  when logged in as an unprivileged user on Windows XP.
* Fixed bug with window positioning when task bar is on left or top of 
  screen.
* Bumped version to 3.0 to keep in sync with the Mac version of BeebEm.

Version 2.3 (Mike Wyatt, Greg Cook, Jon Welch)
-----------
* Added "Motion Blur" option to view menu (suggested by Ian Bell). This 
  all but stops the spaceship flicker in Elite.  
* More 1770 disc controller fixes from Greg.
* Preliminary IDE hard disk support from Jon Welch.
* Torch Z80 second processor emulation from Jon Welch (see README_Z80.TXT).

Version 2.2 (Greg Cook & Mike Wyatt)
-----------
* Fixed BeebEm hang when RS432 is enabled (Acorn Basic Editor works again).
* Fixed LED positioning in modes other than 7.
* Integrated Greg's 1770 disc controller fixes.
* Fixed keyboard handling so Revs works correctly.

Version 2.1 (Mike Wyatt)
-----------
* Added a tape control window for moving the tape position.
* Added support for saving files to UEF tape images.
* Added support for more UEF tape chunk types.
* Added menu option to mute sound chip so tape sound can be heard.
* Added menu option to automatically unlock tape files.
* Tape speed can now be changed without having to reload tape.
* Added tape settings to the UEF state.
* Added BeebEm speed shortcut keys, keypad +/- change speed.

Version 2.0 (Mike Wyatt)
-----------
* Added tube and 65C02 second processor emulation.  It runs the Executive
  version of Elite quite nicely but you will need a reasonably fast PC.
* Added Debugger (see Readme.txt for details).
* Fixed more bugs in the video emulation (fixes Uridium, improves Level 9
  graphical adventures in Master mode).
* Fixed bugs in the joystick and AtoD emulation (SuperPool now works and it
  may fix problems with GamePads).
* Tweaked sound tuning and noise generation.
* Floppy controller selection is now saved for each Model B type.
* Changed default DFS for B+ to the V2.26 Acorn 1770 DFS.
* Rearranged menus a bit as options was getting too big.

Version 1.6 (Ken Lowe & Mike Wyatt)
-----------
* Added BBC Computech IntegraB Support:
  RTC Memory
  Private Memory 1K from &8000 to &83FF
  Private Memory 4K from &8000 to &8FFF
  Private Memory 8K from &9000 to &AFFF
  20K Shadow RAM from &3000 to &7FFF
* Added BBC Plus (128) Support
  20K Shadow RAM from &3000 to &7FFF
  12K Paged RAM
  (Level 9 graphical adventures work in IntegraB & B Plus modes)
* Fixed various bugs in Via Timers (Volcano, Nutcraka, Pedro and Skirmish
  now work).
* Fixed various bugs in UEF state store/restore, particularly for SW RAM
  usage and Master 128 mode (Elite & Exile save/restore now reliable).
* Added disc settings to the UEF state.  When a state is restored BeebEm
  will load the disc images that were loaded when the state was stored.
* Fixed various bugs in the video emulation (fixes Psycastria and Level 9
  graphical adventures, improves FireTrack).
* Changed video emulation so that *TV255 does not move screen down (*TV254 
  does though). Some programs do a *TV255 and the bottom line of the screen
  is lost.
* Fixed reload of drive 1 disc image after a File->Reset.
* Fixed BeebDiscLoad environment variables in Model B modes.
* Fixed ADFS boot (A+Break) in Master 128 mode.
* Removed old BeebState stuff.
* Removed 'Allow ROM Writes - All' option, it was not implemented.

Version 1.5 (Mike Wyatt)
-----------
* Updated the speed regulation code again (should fix hangs).
* Added some more fixed speed settings (you can now play Elite at a 
  decent speed!).
* Put quick load and save back the right way!
* Add a link to the README file to the help menu.
* Changed keyboard maps to default and logical layouts.  The default 
  mapping is the same as the old mapping 1.  Logical mapping maps symbol
  by symbol (for a UK PC keyboard at least) so you get what you press.
* Added keyboard mapping options for A & S and function keys.
* Changed ALT and F10 to normal keys so they no longer select the menu.
  F10 is mapped to f0.
* Made more of the PC keys available for the user defined keyboard.
* Added the File -> Run Disc menu option.
* Added ability to pass name of disc image on command line to run it
  automatically.
* Removed Use Host Clock option from sound menu - its not used.
* Fixed Windows cursor when BeebEm starts up.
* Add some sleeps to the serial comms threads so BeebEm is a bit
  easier on CPU usage.
* Added some extra error checking for file handling.
* Stopped BeebEm from creating the C:\crtc.log file (you can 
  remove this file).
* Tidied up the BeebEm installation directory.  The source code 
  is now kept in a zip file.
* Moved all preference settings into the Windows registry.

* Dialog for opening disc images has 3 new filters:
    - Automatic *.ssd/*.dsd detection
    - *.ssd only
    - *.dsd only

  (1280x1024 makes aliasing effects unnoticable, but requires a fast
  DirectDraw implementation.)
* Added option to use 32-bit DirectDraw modes in full screen, as opposed
  to 8-bit. (In a window, DirectDraw uses the desktop color depth.)
  When combined with "Buffer in video RAM", the result is a *superior*, 
  interpolated display!  Scaling artifacts "disappear" at any resolution.

------------
Fixes the problem with BeebEm hanging after about 35 minutes. 

Version 1.0 (Mike Wyatt)
-----------
Switchable DirectDraw and DirectSound.
Fixed Windows message boxes when using DirectDraw.
Printer support.
Improved ROM size checking.
Improved speed regulation code.

Version 0.9 (Mike Wyatt)
-----------
Added AMX mouse support.

Converted to use DirectX and added a full screen option.

Fixed a few bugs (thanks to Piers Haken for pointing out a bug in the video
code).

Version 0.8 (Mike Wyatt & Laurie Whiffen)
-----------
Added disc write and format capability.

Changed disc load code to give a warning if disc image loaded looks like its
been loaded using wrong type (single/doubled sided).

MS Windows version only:
  Fixed so all key presses are released when windows looses focus.
  Rom slots can be individually changed between ROM and RAM using the menus.
  Added user definable keyboard mapping options.
  User preferences (including the keyboard mapping) can be saved in an INI
    file using a new menu option.
  Added menu options for write protection and creating new disc images.

Version 0.71 (Mike Wyatt)
------------
Changed VIA timer latches initial value to 0xffff (Castle Quest now works).

Fixed BCD addition and substraction and prevented mode 7 code from dividing
by zero (Exile now works).

Changed VIA code so the data direction registers can be read (Codename Droid
now works).

Fixed cursor colour in UNIX version.

Added sideways RAM support (so Exile can be played full screen).

Version 0.7 (Mike Wyatt)
-----------
Added conditional compilation for all the Microsoft Windows code. Should only
need to maintain one set of source files for both the X and MS Win versions.

Changed sound code so it does not play a sound until both the high and low
bytes of the frequency have been set (eliminates spurious high pitch beeps).

Video module now generates a cursor.

Implemented a load of undocumented 6502 instructions.

Directed read and writes to the 16 bytes above each VIA back down to
the VIAs (Castle Quest uses the higher addresses).

Added the atodconv module to provide Analogue to Digital support.  Added the
beebstate module to provide Save and Restore of Beeb State files.  These two
new modules should compile under UNIX but there is currently no code in the
X Windows version to use them.

MS Windows version now provides:
  Load of menus to control everything
  Dynamic disc selection
  Beeb State save and restore
  Various Window sizes
  Real time and fixed frame rate modes
  Sound support
  Joystick support
  Mousestick support
  ROM write protection
  Multiple ROM initialisation
  Games keyboard mapping
  Pentium optimised version

Version 0.6
-----------
A few fiddles with the config for linux - now compiles on 2.7.0 with the ELF-GCC
release; but could cause probs for older releases.

Stated adding sound card.

Version 0.5
-----------
Improved timing - mode 7 bodged to exactly correct cycle count
Interlace timing accounted for in modes 0-6.
Interrupt latency added
fixed window.cc (took out 'virtual' on most functions) - now OK in gcc 2.7.0
Changed default position of g++ includes to /usr/include/g++

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
End
